Module library update
_____________________
November 2023
I'll update this list as modules are added


Many changes, improvements, cleanup, a few fixes.
This updates modules to a standard height of 350px to match the current library "large" size.


VCF's
-------------
Update to VCF's, including 5 new filters and a couple major updates.

SVF multimode 1
SVF multimode 2
Biquad 1 (new, now broken into two filters, first is LP, HP, BP, N)
Biquad 2 (PK, LS, HS, AP)

MM Transistor Ladder (was Mog MM -- that name needs to go away. Fixed the bug).
SEM (update, basic cleanup)
LPF (update, added Sallen Key, revised 303, fixed bugs in Moog filter and 303).
Biquad 2x (new, two biquads in series, using the DSP node to do the heavy lifting generating biquad coeffs and outputting at control rate. A significant reduction in CPU, this looks like the future.
V-OWL (major overhaul -- also using the DSP node, which led to feeling like the vector setup with 4 vowels -- so happy with that at the time -- was getting a little boring. Spiced it up by mapping all ten vowels to the XY pad).
Post EQ (new. Well, old for me. A basic "channel strip" type EQ, low/high shelves, two peak mids, and bass boost).
LP/HP
