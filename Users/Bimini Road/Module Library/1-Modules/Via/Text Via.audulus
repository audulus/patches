Use it to name a connection.\n\nVias are connection tabs that are useful for prototyping and clarifying connections in very large patches or designs.\n\nThey are good for prototyping because you can use a knob to tune a patch and then easily swap it for a value expression - effectively using it as an internal trim pot.\n\nThey are good for clarifying connections because they can route one nodeâ€™s output across a patch and then hook up to, say, a mux node, rather than having 8 long connections run all the way across the patch adding visual clutter.\n","patch":{"id":"21988e47-a595-4fc7-9fee-84c2eb6bc679","pan":{"x":-126.0425,"y":-109.64658},"zoom":1.70874,"nodes":[{"type":"Patch","id":"a4ee26b5-af06-4d6e-a676-8388798b3e7e","position":{"x":110.43045,"y":114.97852},"subPatch":{"id":"ca4bc506-54d0-4131-b83e-e92020914529","pan":{"x":80.97781,"y":34.65807},"zoom":1.59016,"nodes":[{"type":"Input","id":"0107e6ae-32f1-4d08-a347-a6c303d36689","position":{"x":-138.01346,"y":-29.97073},"name":"","exposedPosition":{"x":-25.0,"y":-10.0}},{"type":"Output","id":"e7c84f00-8e60-4e7f-911c-719299be5d5b","position":{"x":-43.0237,"y":-28.49051},"name":"","exposedPosition":{"x":50.0,"y":-10.0}},{"type":"Text","id":"c08e410e-6cae-46ad-923e-e663d633181a","position":{"x":-68.2332,"y":45.5903},"exposedPosition":{"x":-10.0,"y":-10.0},"text":"Audulus","width":256.0}],"wires":[{"from":"0107e6ae-32f1-4d08-a347-a6c303d36689","output":0,"to":"e7c84f00-8e60-4e7f-911c-719299be5d5b","input":0}]}}],"wires":[]}}
