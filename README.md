# Patches

A repository of patches for Audulus.

`/Examples` contains examples that are shown when you create a new document.

`/Library` contains the module library.

`/Users` contains user-contributed patches, organized by author.

Note that when Audulus is built, patches in `Examples` and `Library` are copied into the app. Duplicates, and WIP patches should NOT be in those folders.
