The Random node creates a string of pseudo-random numbers from a starting point called a seed. The problem with this is that a patch utilizing a Random node will sound exactly the same whenever the patch is opened. This module solves that problem by using the microphone input to generate noise, which can then be sampled to create true randomness. The noise floor of an audio input is amplified by a large factor and pushed through a sine waveshaping expression to create what is essentially white noise. The audio input used by True Random can be shared with an instrument without interfering with its operation, or inducing noise into the audio path. The audio channel used can be changed inside the module at the ADC node input. By default, the noise is sampled at 20kHz. To create a true random sample & hold, just combine this module with a clocked sample and hold.","width":336.09161}],"wires":[{"from":"0aa8ab1b-0c1f-468f-baeb-3462de48371d","output":0,"to":"c00c3ef0-807b-459f-91e4-1cf8ed2a7d96","input":0},{"from":"f7a271b0-f9e3-4115-816e-8bf64b45332b","output":0,"to":"c00c3ef0-807b-459f-91e4-1cf8ed2a7d96","input":1},{"from":"c00c3ef0-807b-459f-91e4-1cf8ed2a7d96","output":0,"to":"1db513a8-1bdc-422d-9f19-0344ade65405","input":0},{"from":"1db513a8-1bdc-422d-9f19-0344ade65405","output":0,"to":"3408bc3b-89cf-4af3-8be8-d437d5966df9","input":0},{"from":"02af2015-bc59-45c0-a617-4240aa4afbbd","output":0,"to":"3408bc3b-89cf-4af3-8be8-d437d5966df9","input":1},{"from":"3408bc3b-89cf-4af3-8be8-d437d5966df9","output":0,"to":"96c1122b-db32-4979-bdaf-95262097d6d0","input":0}]}}],"wires":[]}}
