# Patches

A repository of patches for Audulus 3.

`/Examples` contains examples found on macOS, Windows, and Linux version of Audulus. These are shown in the Welcome window.

`/Examples-iOS` contains examples for iOS. These are shown when creating a new patch. We use a spearate directory because iOS can't run as complex patches as other OSes.

`/Library` will contain the module library for all OSes.

`/Users` will contain user-contributed patches, organized by author.
